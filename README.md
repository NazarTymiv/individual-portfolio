## Tech Stack

In this project I will use React with vite template of react, also I will use:

-   **react routing** - for make routs in my app
-   **MongoDB** - for create data base where I will store all my projects
-   **NodeJs** - for create end points and api for control all data into database
-   **express js** - for create my server

## Why This Stack

I will use react for create one page web application of my portfolio also I will use mongo db for store all my projects and probably setting and data for my profile, so I will be able to change all titles, descriptions and photos in my app.

Node js and express js I will use for create my server for communication between user interface and database. I will create there a few end points for add a new project in my database, for delete project, edit that project and probably I will create one end point for change all information in my portfolio.
